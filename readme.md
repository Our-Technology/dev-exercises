# OurTechnology Dev Exercise Monorepo

Thanks for taking the time to checkout out our development exercises. The Goal of this exercise is to assess:

- Your critical thinking skills
- Thought process in solving problems
- Proficiency and understanding of tools, and ability to learn

You'll find exercises for [backend](./packages/backend) and [frontend](./packages/frontend) skillsets, respectively.

Please fork this repo, and submit your work via a Pull Request, and request review from @jpowell. Thanks!

**If you get stuck, please reach out!**

A couple pointers:
- Speak with us before you start to ensure expectations are aligned.
- Use [example config](.env.example) as a guide for environment variables required and put definitions in .env.
- Do not commit any secrets or API keys to git source.
- use `ts-node` to run any of your Typescript files.
- feel free to install any other dependencies you might need, or to initialze any other directories or packages required to satisfy your requirements.
